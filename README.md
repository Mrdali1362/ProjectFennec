# ProjectFennec
Hi,
I'm Ali. I am passionate about accessibility and I work as a designer on my day job. I've started ProjectFennec as side project to help everyone have an equal opportunity to access the web. I am not a developer, all I am doing now is vibe coding with Claude. 

Project Fennec Manifesto
The web belongs to all of us. Yet today, barriers stand between millions of people and the digital world that shapes our lives, our work, and our connections. These barriers aren't natural law—they're human choices. And human choices can be changed.
We envision a web where your abilities don't determine your access. Where technology bends to serve you, not the other way around. Where the phrase "this website isn't accessible" becomes as outdated as "this building has no ramp." This isn't a distant dream—it's an achievable reality.
Project Fennec is building that future. I want to create tools that put power back in users' hands, developed with and by help of the communities that need them most. Every barrier we remove makes the web a little more welcoming, a little more human.
The web was built for everyone. We're making sure everyone can use it.

Join me. The future web is waiting.
